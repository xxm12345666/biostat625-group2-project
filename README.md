# Biostat625 Group 2 Project

Research on Pneumonia Patient Condition Classification Using Diffusion Models and CLIP

## Project Overview

 Pneumonia remains a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. Our study explores large language
 model techniques and generative models to classify pediatric chest X-ray images into normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral
 pneumonia categories. A dataset of 5,856 radiographs was used, with synthetic images generated via
 LoRA fine-tuning of a Stable Diffusion model to address data imbalance. A fine-tuned CLIP model
 achieved modest improvements in training accuracy (from 48.94% to 50.51%), while the test accuracy
 remained at 37.50%.
