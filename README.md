# Biostat625 Group 2 Project

Pneumonia Symptom Classification with Diffusion Models and CLIP

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying pediatric chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia. We utilized machine learning techniques, including Stable Diffusion fine-tuning with LoRA for synthetic image generation and CLIP for robust image classification.
